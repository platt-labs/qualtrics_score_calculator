# Qualtrics Score Calculator
This library was initially built for Platt Labs and contains a series of functions calculating the scores of various behavioral questionaires. These were mostly collected as self-reports using the qualtrics platform and the results were exported CSV-files.

## Initializing the Toolbox
Step 1: Clone the toolbox using git commandline or download and unzip using the GUI.

Step 2: initialize the toolbox by [setting the path globally](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html), or locally specify the path by adding:
```Matlab
addpath('\Your\...\path\...\to\...\qualtrics_score_calculator');
```

## Using the functions in the Toolbox:
Detailed usage of each function can be found using the `help` command in MATLAB command-line.
